# PowerpointTimer - A simple timer AddIn for Powerpoint

This repo contains a Powerpoint VSTO AddIn that adds a button to Powerpoint's toolbar. Clicking the button will add a digital timer textfield (e.g. 05:00) to the center of the active slide. When that slide is shown in a slideshow, the timer runs downto 00:00.

The repo belongs to the following blog post:
